Hello and welcome to my online portfolio! Here, I store all my projects, including those that I have done personally, for school, and for online courses.
Basically, everything that showcases my progress and skill level finds its way here. I am currently a student, but will graduate May 2023 with a shiny
new Bachelors in Computer Science with a focus in Data Analysis. I hope to go on to get a Masters degree in CS as well! My primary language of choice
is Python, but C++ is a close second. I also know Java and SQL. Please take a look around!
